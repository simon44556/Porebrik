## Implementation

This prototype demonstrates a **detection interface** that processes sensor data transmitted via satellite links. Key functionalities include:

1. **Data Transmission**:  
   Autonomous sensors send RF signal data to a backend system through satellite communication.

2. **Signal Processing**:  
   The backend processes the data to:
   - Identify signals based on wavelength and time of detection.
   - Triangulate the source location using advanced algorithms.

3. **Visualization**:  
   The processed data is displayed on an interactive map interface. This provides:
   - Real-time situational awareness.
   - Clear visualization of detected signals and their locations.

**Note**: This prototype focuses on demonstrating the user interface and data presentation. Full-scale deployment and hardware integrations are future steps.
